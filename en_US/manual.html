			You start a game and others join you
			<p>Click on the <em>OPTIONS</em> menu. In the <em>NETWORK</em> options select connection type (<em>Connection - LAN/Internet</em>). Set the online players limit (<em>Max Players</em> - should be small if you have a slow internet connection). The game can be registered in <em>the lobby server</em> in internet games (<em>REGISTER IN LOBBY SERVERS</em>), so other players can find your game in the <em>JOIN GAME</em> servers search.

	<h4>Commands from a parameter:</h4>
	<p>These are parameters that can be used when running Soldat.exe:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Soldat.exe <strong>-dedicated</strong>
			<p>Starts a Soldat dedicated server.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Soldat.exe <strong>-start</strong>
			<p>Starts the game without entering the menu.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Soldat.exe <strong>-dedicated -start</strong>
			<p>Runs the dedicated server automatically.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Soldat.exe <strong>-join IPnumber (port password)</strong>
			<p>Runs the game and connects to <em>IPnumber</em>, <em>port</em> and <em>password</em> are optional.</p>
			<p>Example:<br>Soldat.exe -join 62.93.201.70<br>Soldat.exe -join 127.0.0.1 23073 tikikaka</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Soldat.exe <strong>-demo name (freecam speed notexts extract)</strong>
			<p>Runs the game and plays the demo specified by <em>name</em>. Optional paramaters are:</p>
			<ul class="flat">
				<li>freecam (0/1) - the user can freely change the camera (default 1)</li>
				<li>speed (0-...%)- how quick the playback will be specified in percents (default 100%)</li>
				<li>notexts (0/1) - no texts, menus or cursor will be displayed during playback (default 0)</li>
				<li>extract (0/1) - extracts the demo to BMP files (default 0). Later they can be used to make an AVI file in a program like &quot;Bmp2Avi&quot;.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The sound can be extracted with a program like &quot;Total Recorder&quot;. Please note that this can take time and is not recommended on slower systems. For better results specify lower speed (like 50%).</p>
			<p>Example:<br>Soldat.exe -demo demo12<br>Soldat.exe -demo demo19 1 200 1 0</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			Soldat.exe <strong>-mod xxx</strong>
			<p>Starts the game with a Soldat mod located in Soldat\Mods\xxx</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
	<p>The default key for Chat function is <em>T</em> (for team chat <em>Y</em>), to send it press <em>ENTER</em>.</p>
	<h4>Taunts</h4>
	<p>You can use ready taunts from the file TAUNTS.TXT (placed in the Soldat folder or your profile folder) by using the <em>ALT</em> key + alpha-numeric keyboard keys.</p>
	<h4>Teamchat</h4>
	<p>If you want your chat text to appear in the console only for your teammates insert &quot;^&quot; before the text, like this: ^Whats up!</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="server">Dedicated Server</h3>
	<p>A dedicated server is used to run a faster Soldat server without a player.</p>
	<p>You can do this in two ways:</p>
	<ol class="server">
		<li>In the <em>SOLDAT.INI</em> file, section <em>NETWORK</em>, find <em>Dedicated=0</em>, change it to <em>Dedicated=1</em>.</li>
		<li>
			Run the game with the parameter -dedicated (Soldat.exe -dedicated). You can use the shortcuts in the Start Menu.
			<p>If you want the server to start the game automatically do this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Run the game normally and enter the menu. Set all the game options (game mode, time limit, map list etc.)</li>
				<li>Quit the game and the settings will be saved</li>
				<li>Run Soldat with parameters -dedicated -start</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Remote administration</h4>
	<p>Players from outside the server can control it. To give this option to a player add him to the Remote Admins list. The commands for this are described here <a href="#commands">COMMANDS</a>.</p>
	<h4>Game Ports</h4>
	<p>Important! - If you have a firewall you should open the UDP game ports<br>default: 23073 for the server (can be changed in Soldat Setup) , client uses a default port: 23083 (can't be changed)<br>There is an option to join firewall servers without opening the ports, but only through the lobby server (through the server list - forwarding).</p>
	<p>The Soldat server uses the following ports:<br>UDP: game port (default 23073)<br>TCP/IP: admin port = game port (default 23073)<br>TCP/IP: files port = game port + 10 (default 23083)</p>
	<hr>
	<h3 id="anticheat">ANTI-CHEAT Protection</h3>
	<p>The Soldat network Anti-Cheat Protection is based on two modules.</p>
	<p>Software company's developing multiplayer games spend millions of dollars, hundreds of hours, the work of thousands of people are wasted to invent the perfect anti-cheat systems. All those systems are as good as nothing because they forgot about one tiny little thing. The author of Soldat got the idea after 4 seconds of thinking. Now Sierra and other On-Line industry giants can't stand it that they didn't think of it first. The first Anti-Cheat Protection module in Soldat is simply:</p>
	<ol class="anticheat">
		<li>
			A request: <strong>&quot;Please don't cheat while playing Soldat&quot;</strong>.
			<p>If that somehow doesn't work then please read this:</p>
		</li>
		<li>Because of the Anti-Cheat protection system used in Soldat you cannot use any hack tools like: memory finders, trainers, packet editors, hex editors and dissasemblers while Soldat is running. It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to CLOSE all programs running in the background while Soldat is on. The use of hack tools will degrade the game to a level it will no longer be playable. Also editing the executable or other related files and cracking the shareware protection will cause system instability and problems with network play. If this happens to you and you are sure you did not do anything illegal please contact the author.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please remember that this is a small shareware game made by one man. If you try to break the game protection you make harm to yourself because I can stop making the game if I'm without money and with overload of work making new anti-hack and anti-cheat systems all the time. If you want to hack something please concentrate on big company's like EA Games. Hacking a big commercial title will prove that you are good, please leave Soldat alone.</p>
